- To manage the opam environment I first initialized opam using the `--bare` option
- In the `shell.nix` I'm running the opam init again. If it is already initialzed it has no effect.
    - it ensures that opam is initialized
- Then I manually create a local switch in my dev repo: `opam switch create ./`
- And I add the dependency like: `dune`, `ocaml-lsp-server` and everything that is needed.
    - not the with nixos the system dependencies must be handled manually
